“How! Don Emanuel,” exclaimed Sebastian, “do you pretend to persuade me
of these animated sentiments, and yet deny me the only favor peculiarly
your own to bestow? as your sovereign I may command your services and
life; but when I ask of you with the simplicity of an equal, to resign
the shadow of a right over a woman whom _you_ cannot love, whom _I_
love with all the ardour of virtuous tenderness, and who blesses me in
return, when I ask _this_ at your hands, you capriciously, tyrannically
deny me. What conduct is this? how dare you mock me with expressions of
devoted regard?”

Embarrassed yet not confounded, Don Emanuel was silent; the king
pressed his remark with increased ardour, adding, in a tone of greater
emotion, “You were contracted to Donna Gonsalva at the age of thirteen,
you went immediately after to India, from whence you are returned
but three months; in that period you have seen the fair Gonsalva
only thrice, and that in reserved interviews before her aunt, where
nothing beyond personal graces could speak to your senses. No charm
of varied discourse; no enchantment of sensibility could penetrate to
your soul; the coldness of her feelings must have chilled yours: love
feeds, grows, lives upon love! Can you then, will you then have the
injustice to place your mere admiration of her beauty upon a par with
my lively preference of her character, and my tender sympathy with her
disinterested affection? Have a care, Don Emmanuel, force me not to
resume the King; you may rouse me into measures which otherwise I would
have spurned.”
